=============
Yaw
=============

  *With this function you can rotate a drone around its axis. Note, if the drones are in a formation, each drone will rotate around its axis and not the formation itself. If your drone is only equipped with a light source at the bottom of the drone, this function will have little or no effect. Rather, this capability is intended for special drones with side light sources or for special drone creations.*

  - Properties

    - Start

      *Shows the time when a action yaw starts. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always adjust the starting position numerically.*

    - Duration

      *Specifies the duration of the action. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always numerically adjust the duration.*

    - Drones

      *With drones you can make a choice to which the action is applies. You can apply the action to all drones, then choose "all drones" or you can apply the action to one or more selected drones and then choose edit => select the drone => use selected drone*

    - Remove

      *With this button you delete the action that you have placed in the timeline.*

    - Relative yaw

      *With relative yaw you can enter the number of degrees by which the drones rotate around their axis. With the slider you can turn this function on or off.*

    - Keyframes

      * With a keyframe you can add a movement or application to your design. On the basis of a start and end point, you can place this application on the timeline of your clip or scene and move it as desired. Between these two points the action (yaw) will be active. *
