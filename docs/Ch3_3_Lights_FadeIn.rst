    - Drones

      *With drones you can make a choice to which the action is applies. You can apply the action to all drones, then choose "all drones" or you can apply the action to one or more selected drones and then choose edit => select the drone => use selected drone*

    - Blende mode

      *With blende mode you have different options to mix colors, an extra color on top of the basic color that is given from the start page.*

    - Opacity

      *The higher the number, the darker the color.*

    - Easing

      *Nothing in nature moves linearly from one point to another. In reality, things tend to speed up or slow down as they move. Our brains are wired to expect these types of movements, so if you are animating you should use this to your advantage. Natural movement makes your users feel more comfortable with your design, which in turn leads to a better overall experience.*

      - Linear

        *The fade-in without any smoothing, the values increase in equal amounts.*

      - Ease in

        *The fade-in starts slowly and accelerates towards the end.*

      - Ease out

        *The fade-in starts quickly and slows down towards the end.*

      - Ease in-out

        *The fade-in starts slow, accelerates towards the center and slows back towards the end.*

      - none

        *Fade-in without easing function.*

    - Keyframes

      * With a keyframe you can add a movement or application to your layout. On the basis of a start and end point, you can place this application on the timeline of your clip or scene and move it as desired. Between these two points the action (fade in) will be active. *
