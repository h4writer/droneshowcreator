Rotation
========================

  *You can rotate the design around various axes. Via properties you can enter different details for the desired rotation. See chapter 4.3.4 "properties" for more information.*

  - Properties

    - Start

      *Shows the time when a action rotation starts. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always adjust the starting position numerically.*

    - Duration

      *Specifies the duration of the action. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always numerically adjust the duration.*

    - Drones

      *With drones you can make a choice to which the action is applies. You can apply the action to all drones, then choose "all drones" or you can apply the action to one or more selected drones and then choose edit => select the drone => use selected drone*

    - Rotation front, side, top

      *Here you can enter the number of degrees that the layout must be rotated according to 3 positions, front, side or top. The rotation point is automatically central to the design.* 

    - Rotation point X Y Z

      *Here you can adjust the point where the rotation happens according to the X (= left, right), Y (= forward, backward) and Z (= top, bottom) axis. By default this point is placed in the middle point.*

    - Keyframes

      * With a keyframe you can add a movement or application to your layout. On the basis of a start and end point, you can place this application on the timeline of your clip or scene and move it as desired. Between these two points the action (rotation) will be active.*
