    - Duration

      *Specifies the duration of the action. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always numerically adjust the duration.*

    - Drones

      *With drones you can make a choice to which the action is applies. You can apply the action to all drones, then choose "all drones" or you can apply the action to one or more selected drones and then choose edit => select the drone => use selected drone*

    - Remove

      *With this button you delete the action that you have placed in the timeline.*

    - Blende mode

      *With blende mode you have different options to mix colors, an extra color on top of the basic color that is given from the start page.*

    - Opacity

      *The higher the number, the darker the color.*
