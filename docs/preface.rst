- Vieuw part
In this section you will find the tools to place and select drones within a layout. The placed drones can be visualized in different positions in a simulation using an in and out zoom function. It is also possible to follow the timeline numerically and possibly to slow down or speed up the time.

- Clips
With clips you will find the timeline with the layout. The layout can consist of different scenes that together form the drone show. A scene can consist of several underlying scenes. You can also use different sequences to place the scene blocks. In addition to the sequence, one can also place an audio sequence

- Scene list
All new scenes that are created are listed here. You can always copy, export, delete or create a new one. Scenes can always be recorded within other scenes.
