 *If you click on this, a clip will automatically appear on the timeline without a panel appearing. This clip automatically contains a grid, at the bottom right of the interface at properties you can adjust the grid to your liking in terms of design and number of drones. When the clip is created in the timeline => right mouse button => edit actions for more options*

Method: first click with the mouse in the black part where the layout is visualized, then use the directional arrows.*
 
3.2.2 Chrono time

 *This time indication shows the position of the cursor needle in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. If you move the cursor manually, the chrone will be adjusted automatically. The reverse way can also be used if you have to place the cursor very precisely, then enter the correct time indication to place the cursor very accurately.*
 
3.2.2 Play buttons

*The left button is used to automatically return the cursor needle to the beginning of the layout.
The middle button is used to play the format. The right button is used to automatically move the cursor needle to the end of the markup, that is, at the end of the last block on the sequence line*
