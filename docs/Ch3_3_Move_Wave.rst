Wave
===============

  *With this function you can automatically add a wave movement to your design. For example, the effect of a waving flag. Via properties you can enter various details for the desired wave.*

  - Properties

    - Start

      *Shows the time when a action wave starts. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always adjust the starting position numerically.*

    - Duration

      *Specifies the duration of the action. The unit is displayed in milliseconds. 3,000ms = 3 sec. You can always numerically adjust the duration.*

    - Drones

      *With drones you can make a choice to which the action is applies. You can apply the action to all drones, then choose "all drones" or you can apply the action to one or more selected drones and then choose edit => select the drone => use selected drone*

    - Remove

      *With this button you delete the action that you have placed in the timeline.*

    - Height

      *Here you determine the distance that the drone travels within its wave movement. The higher the number, the greater the wave movement.*

    - Time offset

      *This determines the time the drone will take from point A to point B to make the wave movement.*

    - Angle

      *This is the angle at which the wave will occur on the entire design. If you place a grid and you take a wave of 0 ° it will move from left to right. At 90 ° the wave will move from back to front, and at 180 ° from right to left. Note, this function only works with the XV plane (=> this plane can be found in the start page => properties => plane).*

    - Iterations

      *Here you can enter the number of wave movements that the layout will make during the duration. Example: With a duration of 3 seconds and an iteration of 5, the format will make 5 waves during those 3 seconds.*

    - Keyframes

      * With a keyframe you can add a movement or application to your design. On the basis of a start and end point, you can place this application on the timeline of your clip or scene and move it as desired. Between these two points the action (wave) will be active. *
