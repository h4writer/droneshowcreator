  If you click on this, a clip will automatically appear on the timeline without a panel appearing. This clip automatically contains a grid, at the bottom right of the interface at properties you can adjust the grid to your liking in terms of design and number of drones. When the clip is created in the timeline => right mouse button => edit actions for more options

4.1.3 Clip timeline
-------------------
 
 4.1.3.1 Sequence
  
  A sequence is a horizontal space on the timeline where a markup block (=clip) can be placed. You can create as many sequences vertically one below the other as needed for the intended end result. You can create a new sequence by clicking on the icon for new sequence to the left of the timeline or by dragging a format block down. A sequence is only intended for formatting and not for placing audio files.
   
 4.1.3.2 Music sequence
   
  This is the same as the regular sequence but only intended for placing audio files. This makes it easy to synchronize image and audio with each other
    
 4.1.3.3 Cursor
   
  The blue cursor needle always indicates the position of the visualization in the layout timeline. The needle can always be moved manually, but it is also magnetic, which means that if you drag a markup clip or scene block to a different position, the needle will move along and move magnetically and take up position at the right end of that clip or scene block. You can also adjust the position of the cursor needle in the clock in the viewport, by adjusting the values the needle will take the position, this can be useful if you have to work in milliseconds. When placing a new markup clip or scene block, the block will always be placed where the cursor needle is located. Note, it may be that there is not enough space next to the needle to place a new block because it has, for example, a very long time zone. in that case select a new sequence line that is still free to place the scene block.

    
 4.1.3.4 Timeline zoom in and out
 
  You can also zoom in and out on the sequence timeline to make the clip or scene blocks bigger or smaller => place the cursor on the numerical indication and roll the mouse wheel to enlarge or reduce.

  
4.1.4 Scene list
-----------------

 4.1.4.1 Main

  In this list, all the different scenes are listed. A scene is a block in the timeline that contains clips with the layout of a certain figuration .
The program always automatically places a first blank scene = main scene, this scene can be copied, exported or deleted. You do this by selecting the scene and using the right mouse button.
 4.1.4.2 New

  At the bottom of the sub-frame you can also choose to create a new scene. At properties you will then be given the option to rename all scenes. So a main scene can be composed of all other separate scenes. Example: scene A is placed in scene B, scene B is placed in scene C and scene C is placed in the main scene => the main scene then contains both scene A, B and C. Placing a scene in another scene is done via the book icon in the viewport. Every scene that is in the scene list is also in the book icon
