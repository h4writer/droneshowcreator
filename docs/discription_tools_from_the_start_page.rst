 4.1.3.1 Sequence
  
  A sequence is a horizontal space on the timeline where a markup block can be placed. You can create as many sequences vertically one below the other as needed for the intended end result. You can create a new sequence by clicking on the icon for new sequence to the left of the timeline or by dragging a format block down. A sequence is only intended for formatting and not for placing audio files.
   
 4.1.3.2 Music sequence
   
  This is the same as the regular sequence but only intended for placing audio files. This makes it easy to synchronize image and audio with each other
    
 4.1.3.3 Cursor
   
  The blue cursor needle always indicates the position of the visualization in the layout timeline. The needle can always be moved manually, but it is also magnetic, which means that if you drag a markup block to a different position, the needle will move along and move magnetically and take up position at the right end of that block. You can also adjust the position of the cursor needle in the clock in the viewport, by adjusting the values ​​the needle will take the position, this can be useful if you have to work in milliseconds. When placing a new markup block, the block will always be placed where the cursor needle is located. Note, it may be that there is not enough space next to the needle to place a new block because it has, for example, a very long time zone. in that case select a new sequence line that is still free to place the block.

    
 4.1.3.4 Timeline zoom in and out
 
  You can also zoom in and out on the sequence timeline to make the blocks bigger or smaller => place the cursor on the numerical indication and roll the mouse wheel to enlarge or reduce.
